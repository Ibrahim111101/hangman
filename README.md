## Description
This is a simple Hangman game created as a fun project. The game is based on the classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The aim of this project is to create an entertaining game to enjoy and learn more about programming.

## Features
- Random word selection for guessing.
- Limited number of attempts for guessing the word.
- Visual representation of the hangman figure as you guess wrong letters.
- End game condition (win or lose).

## How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies (if there are any).
3. Run the Hangman game.
4. The game will select a random word, and you need to guess it one letter at a time.
5. You have a limited number of attempts, and with each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn.
6. Try to guess the word before the hangman is completely drawn to win.

## Installation
To run this game, you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
