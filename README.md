## Description
This is a simple Hangman game created as a fun project. The game is based on the classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. The aim of this project is to create an entertaining game to enjoy and learn more about programming.

## What I learned
During the development of this Hangman game project, I, as the creator, had the opportunity to acquire and reinforce several key skills and knowledge areas:

- Python Programming: I deepened my understanding of Python, using it to implement game logic, handle user input, and manage game state.

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): This project allowed me to practice OOP principles by creating classes, methods, and objects to structure the game.

- User Interaction: Implementing user input and feedback systems improved my ability to create interactive applications.

- Game Development Concepts: I explored the basics of game development, including word selection, and win/lose conditions.

- Problem-Solving: Working on this project honed my problem-solving skills as I encountered and resolved various challenges along the way.


## Features
- Random word selection for guessing.
- Limited number of attempts for guessing the word.
- Visual representation of the hangman figure as you guess wrong letters.
- End game condition (win or lose).

## How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies (if there are any).
3. Run the Hangman game.
4. The game will select a random word, and you need to guess it one letter at a time.
5. You have a limited number of attempts, and with each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn.
6. Try to guess the word before the hangman is completely drawn to win.

## Installation
To run this game, you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-game.git
   cd hangman-game
# Usage

- Use the keyboard to input your letter guesses.
- Track your progress and try to guess the word with the fewest attempts.
- Enjoy and have fun playing!
